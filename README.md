# scipion-em-xmipp

Plugin to use Xmipp programs within the Scipion framework.

You can install it either, using the Scipion software following 
the [Scipion's installation guide](https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/docs/scipion-modes/install-from-sources.html#installing-scipion-v3-0)
(**strongly recommended for non-developers**) or cloning it on your own and 
[linking it to Scipion](https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/docs/scipion-modes/install-plugins-command-line.html#devel-mode).
The latter is only for those who intended to develop the Xmipp plugin but **not the whole Xmipp software**.

For **developers**, we strongly recommend to follow the guide on 
[how to install xmipp-bundle](https://github.com/i2pc/xmipp#xmipp-as-a-standalone-bundle-for-developers) 
in order to get a complet Xmipp's development ecosystem.
