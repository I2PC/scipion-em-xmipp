# scipion-em-xmipp

Plugin to use Xmipp programs within the Scipion framework.

You can install it either, using the Scipion software following 
the [Scipion's installation guide](https://scipion-em.github.io/docs/release-3.0.0/docs/scipion-modes/how-to-install.html)
, (remember to install the scipion-em-xmipp plugin or remove the -noXmipp flag in the Scipion installation)**strongly recommended for non-developers** or cloning it on your own and 
[linking it to Scipion](https://github.com/I2PC/xmipp#linking-standalone-version-to-scipion).
The latter is only for those who intended to develop the Xmipp plugin.

For **developers**, we strongly recommend to follow the guide on 
[how to install xmipp-bundle](https://github.com/i2pc/xmipp#xmipp-as-a-standalone-bundle-for-developers) 
in order to get a complet Xmipp's development ecosystem.
